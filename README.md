# Watering Cans

Wonderful watering cans!  Help farm crops or fight fires.  Implemented as a standalone mod, originally from Extra Utilities.

## Features

Watering cans will:

* Speed up growth ticks
* Hydrate soil
* Put out fires
* Spray water particles

## Tiers

Watering cans are tiered so there is no obvious "best" choice.

* Stone - Cheap to make, but only stores half a tank
* Iron - Jack of all trades, master of none
* Gold - Faster hydration (1.3x), but can only be filled once
* Obsidian - Heavier to use, but offers 5x5 reach

## Notes

* To create growth solution, craft bonemeal and a water bucket together.  Place the liquid in the world and use the watering can on it.
* Watering cans only increase random tile updates.  They don't accelerate tick updates such as furnace progress.
