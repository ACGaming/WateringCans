Wonderful watering cans!  Adds 4 watering cans to help farm crops, or quickly put out fires.

Idea originally from Extra Utilities, now implemented as a standalone mod.

Watering cans will:

* Speed up growth ticks (configurable rate)
* Hydrate soil
* Put out fires
* Spray water particles

## Materials

Watering cans are tiered so there is no obvious "best" choice.

* Stone - Cheap to make, but only stores half a tank.
* Iron - Your standard watering can.  It's a jack of all trades but master of none.
* Gold - Faster hydration (1.5x), but can only be filled once.
* Obsidian - Heavier to use, but offers 5x5 reach.

## Growth Solution

Growth solution offers a 2.5x efficiency increase over regular water.  Crafted with a water bucket with bonemeal, it can be placed in the world to pick up with your watering can.
