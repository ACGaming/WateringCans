# Watering Cans
Standalone and customizable watering cans, originally from Extra Utilities.

Please note this is a working document, and no features are final.

## Features
Different watering cans affect hydration speed, storage capacity, and durability.  
Fully configurable.  Disable any features or tweak balance.

Watering tiles will:
* Speed up growth ticks
* Temporarily hydrate soil
* Put out fires
* Sprays water particles

## Tiers
* Stone - Poor traits, very affordable
* Iron - Jack of all trades, master of none
* Gold - Very fast hydration, very low durability
* Obsidian - No durability bar, slightly slower than iron

## Costs for use (configurable)
* Durability
* Water refill
* Bonemeal
* No plans for RF/Tesla
 
## Notes
* To create growth solution, craft bonemeal and a water bucket together.  Place the liquid in the world and use the watering can on it.
* Watering cans are intentionally not tiered so there's an obvious "best" choice.  Growth solution however is a direct upgrade to plain water.
* Watering cans only increase random tile updates.  They don't accelerate tick updates such as Furnace progress.
